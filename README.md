I am a Full Stack Engineer with more than 6 years of professional software development experience using Javascript & Typescript (Node.js, React, Angular). I love working with leading technologies like Python | Microservices | GraphQL Federation | CI/CD Pipeline | Docker | Kubernetes | AWS | Argocd | Agile Methodologies. As a quick learner, I love to take on new challenges and I occasionally share my knowledge by writing blog posts so that developers can get an advantage from that.
