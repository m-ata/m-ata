### Hi I'm Muhammad Ata ðŸ‘‹ :computer:
I am a Frontend Engineer having expertise in front-end related technologies such as Reactjs, Angular, Nextjs, SASS, BEM, MUI, Bootstrap, Ant etc . I love to code in Javascript and Typescript based technologies :heart:. I am a constant learner and I ocassionally share my knowledge by writing blog posts so that developers can get advantage from that. Apart from that I am fond of watching cricket and I like to visit touristic places.
